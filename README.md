## Day 0: Hello, World
 To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.
You've got this!

**Note:** The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the *inputString*
variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

**Input Format** : 
A single line of text denoting *inputString* (the variable whose contents must be printed).

**Output Format** : 
Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of *inputString* on the second line.

**Solution** : Refer **day_0.py** file
